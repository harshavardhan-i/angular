// •  Here form tag can be thought of as a selector for some angular directive
// • Need to import FormsModule in modules
// • need to add ngModel and a name to form elements like input and selection

// • Now we don't have to add a eventListener on the submit button
// • define (ngSubmit) on the form element and call on submit… button type should be submit 
// • Angular makes use of the default actions triggered on submit button click
// • Now define a local reference and assign it a string named "NgForm"
// • This local can be passed to the function being called on ngSubmit
    





// • alternatively viewChild can be used
//     ○ @viewChild('f') submitForm: ngForm;
