// • Ahead of time vs Just in time compilation
// • 
// • Our code and template is converted to javascript by typescript compiler
// • Then this is angular compiler compiles the template into javascript DOM instructions
// • All of this happens during run time and causes a small performance hit, JIT
// • AOT does the entire process during the build phase
