// • There are two types of data we can pass when we route 
// ○ Static 
// ○ Dynamic
// • Static data can be passed by using data: {key: 'value'} within the routes variable and use the activated route class snapshot.data[key]
// • For dynamically fetching data we need to use resolvers - They basically load data before rendering the url or loading the component
