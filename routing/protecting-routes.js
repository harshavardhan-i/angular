// • To protect routes we can use canActivate key within the routes
// • To use this we'll have to make an additional service which implements CanActivate class within angular router
// • If this is added to the parent component it protects the child as well
// • CanActivateChild is used to guard all the child components, defined at the parent route level
// • Can deactivate is used to keep the user in the same page when the changes are not saved
