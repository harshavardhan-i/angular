// • Usually this is how the data flows we subscribe to an observable and the observer then gets us data
// • We can introduce middle men called operators to process the data being send to the observer
// • We can then subscribe to the result of these operators


// • We use pipe method within observables to add operators 
// • map, filter are some examples of such observables
