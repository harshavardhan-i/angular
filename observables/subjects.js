// • These are also observables
// • Just like eventEmitters they are to be implemented
// • Instead of emit we use next that triggers it
// • and we still subscribe to it since it's an observable
// • Subjects are better than eventEmitters so should be used instead 
// • Only use subjects while passing data through the service Not while using @output()
