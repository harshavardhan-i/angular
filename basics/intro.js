// • Javascript framework
// • Helps create reactive single page applications

// Angular versions -
// • Angular 1 or AngularJS are the same
// • Angular 2 was a complete rewrite of Angular 1, released in 2016!
// • Since angular 2 versioning started and updated every six months there's no rewrite
// • Angular version 2,3,4,5,….9 are all cumulatively known as Angular
// • Angular 9 is the same as angular 2 with some minor changes

// Angular CLI
// • Use of angular CLI to build and run projects is recommended
// • Optimizes our code 
// • Node JS is used by the CLI to bundle and optimize our project
// • NPM - node package manager … Manages different dependencies, like framework and libraries

// Commands - 
// • npm install -g @angular/cli@latest - -g globally installs angular cli and @ latest is optional
// • ng new projectName - creates new project, cannot use test as a name as it’s a keyword
// • ng serve - bring up a development server and run the build , runs on localhost:4200 by default. Re builds the projects when ever there's a change

// TypeScript - 
// • Angular uses a superset of JavaScript called TypeScript, which is then compiled down to JavaScript 
// • Typescripts has classes, interfaces etc
// • Strongly typed - you define if a particular var is number or string or else
// • Can't assign a number to string variable, whereas vanilla javascript is dynamically type and such assignments are allowed there(checked at the time we type the code not when it's run)
// • Typescript does not run on browser, Javascript runs on browser

// Package.json -
// •  contains all the dependencies of your file
// • Project dependencies for angular, has third party dependencies
// • Development dependencies
// • node_module are where all these dependencies are installed


// • Angular is multiple packages or submodules 
// • To utilize these submodules we need to import those in app.module.ts
